The an ollama AI is playing a text adventure along with you.
I only have DeepSeek-r1 on my PC right now because it is small.
You can enter commands or allow the AI to choose what to do.
I want to keep developing this and adding other commands and activities.
I think it would be awesome to have two AIs meet, etc.
The adventure game itself is pretty self-explanatory.
There are areas connected to other areas with directional commands.
There are a few hidden commands like:
ai = Have the AI tell you what move to make for it.
map = draw a simple map from the current room.
cheat = Use the A* algorithm to tell you the rooms from here to the goal.
help = Display a few lines of help.
So far, the AI hasn't discovered any of those commands. :)
Contributions are welcome!
